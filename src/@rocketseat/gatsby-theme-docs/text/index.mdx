# Introduction

The CA, in alignment with CAF/DND, will digitally transform across all lines of operations and functional business areas. Embracing automation, advanced data-driven technologies, client-centric service delivery and interoperable systems both internally and with our Allies places immense emphasis on the need to implement and practice industry best practices for ** data management (DM) **. 

The CA risks realizing none of the digital transformation outcomes mandated or desired without persistent and determined leadership commitment and adequate resourcing to establish and maintain the CAâ€™s data layer.

## Highlights

- ðŸ’½ Data are a vital enterprise asset. Managed optimally, they have the potential to unlock insights about personnel, equipment, outputs, operations and more.
- ðŸ’¡Data are critical for innovation and paramount to achieving strategic goals. Reliable, high-quality data enables Comds at all levels to make better decisions. 
- ðŸ’° Failure to manage data is like failure to manage capital. It results in waste, lost opportunity and damaged credibility.
- ðŸŒŽ The CA must evolve its DM practices and competencies to maintain relevance and learn to thrive in an increasingly accelerating data and digital landscape. 
- ðŸ“ˆIncreased volume and velocity of data captured through a wide range of processes and formats adds significant complexity in providing useable data backed decision support to Comds.
