HR-Civ Certificate in Data Excellence

 


What is the HR-Civ Certificate
________________________________________
                                                                                                                                                            
HR-Civ is for both beginners and people who are more experienced working with data. This data training is all about improving decision making & combining that with your CAF/Defence experience. It doesn't matter if you are really good with numbers and love analyzing trends - or if you've always avoided that type of work. These courses are for everyone, but more specifically have a focus on material that more specifically is designed to support HR practitioners in making evidence based decisions. 
 
As you progress through this certificate program, you'll meet people from across HR-Civ who are trying to use data to improve their work – together, you will accomplish so much more. Connection and collaboration is really the secret: data points mean nothing without the people to collaborate about the findings and trends.
