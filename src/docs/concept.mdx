### Intent

We will establish and sustain an effective ** data layer ** for the CA that enables the use of data in all programs and activities to innovate, enhance capabilities and decision-making and create value through operational effectiveness and the efficient management of resources.

We will rapidly and incrementally integrate and operationalize an effective Data Organization and Management Framework in the CA to ensure data are leveraged in all activities and operations.  

Data governance will become an integrated component of the CA governance cycle, providing the means for Comds to issue direction and achieve CA consensus around data initiatives and objectives and set CA DM and innovation priorities that inform enterprise-level data governance steering committees.

We will exercise superb management and leadership and supply focused intention, planning, coordination, and commitment to help innovate, derive value from data and use it to reach organizational and strategic goals. 

As the backbone of digital transformation and modernization, effective DM enables innovation and exploration of advanced data-centric technologies including artificial intelligence and machine learning that will allow us to keep pace with our allies and stay ahead of our adversaries in the digital realm.
