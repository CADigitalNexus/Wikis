[Close Engagement](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/dnd-mdn/army/lineofsight/files/articlefiles/en/Close_Engagement.pdf)

Land Power in an Age of Uncertainty is the capstone future land operating concept designed to guide the development of Canadian land forces for the next 10 to 15 years. It has been written to nest within Canada’s defence policy and the CAF’s joint concepts, while providing the necessary underlying philosophy for organizing, equipping, training, and employing Canadian land forces within an integrated CAF joint force. It replaces the 2007 publication Land Operations 2021, Adaptive Dispersed Operations: The Force Employment Concept for Canada’s Army of Tomorrow, which was designed to serve “not as the end but rather the starting point for further debate, design, and development of the Army of Tomorrow."

## Strategic(s)

[![Canada's Defence Policy Cover Photo](/static/Canada's%20Defence%20Policy%20Strong%2C%20Secure%2C%20Engaged.png)](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/reports-publications/canada-defence-policy.html)

[Canada's Defence Policy: Strong, Secure, Engaged(SSE)](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/reports-publications/canada-defence-policy.html)

Strong, Secure, Engaged presents a new vision and approach to defence by the Government of Canada. This new defence policy provides unprecedented support to our people and their families. We ask a great deal of our people, from deploying on peace operations to responding to humanitarian crises.

[![Policy on Service and Digital](/static/GC%20Policy%20on%20Service%20and%20Digital.png)](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603)

[Policy on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603)

The objective of this policy is as follows:
* 3.1.1 Client service experience and government operations are improved through digital transformation approaches.
* 3.2 The expected government-wide results of this policy are as follows:
* 3.2.1 Integrated decision-making is supported by enterprise governance, planning and reporting;
* 3.2.2 Service delivery, business and program innovation are enabled by technology and data;
* 3.2.3 Service design and delivery is client-centric by design; and
* 3.2.4 Workforce capacity and capability development is supported.

[Strategic Planning Directive (SPD) (2020-2021)](https://collaboration-admdia.forces.mil.ca/sites/DIA/DRBM/Refs/Strategic_Planning_Directive_2020-2021-EN.pdf)

The purpose of this Strategic Planning Directive (SPD), formerly the Defence Plan, is to ensure the alignment of the Department's financial resources to the activities necessary to fulfill its Defence policy obligations and will therefore serve as planning guidance for the upcoming resource cycle. While the core principles of Canada's Defence Policy: Strong, Secured, Engaged (SSE) remain unchanged and much of the previous Defence Plan 2018-2023 remains relevant, there will always be a need for adjustments and refine our heading as needed to evolve together as an institution. While this document sets the strategic course for shaping FY 2020-21 resource planning, the Abbreviated Business Planning Process Call Letter (Reference H) provides details regarding actual L1 business plans submissions.

## Strategies

[Report to Privy Council: Data Strategy Roadmap for the Federal Public Service](https://www.canada.ca/en/privy-council/corporate/clerk/publications/data-strategy.html)

[![DND/CAF Data Strategy Cover Photo](/static/DND_CAF%20Data%20Strategy.png)](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/reports-publications/data-strategy.html)

[DND/CAF Data Strategy](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/reports-publications/data-strategy.html)

In June 2017, the Department of National Defence and Canadian Armed Forces (DND/CAF) released its new defence policy Strong, Secure, Engaged (SSE). It acknowledges that much of Canada’s tactical advantage is due to “agile information management and technology tools to aggregate and manipulate large quantities of data”, and that the future of Defence will place a “greater emphasis on information technologies, data analytics, deep learning, autonomous systems, advancements in the electromagnetic and cyber domains”. The scope of DND/CAF Data Strategy includes all data held in any repository in any format, and at any point in the data lifecycle. This includes data created, collected, and/or used both in military operations and exercises, and in corporate administrative processes (e.g., HR, finance).
While related, Information management (IM) is covered in the Chief Information Officer’s (CIO) Defence Information Strategy and is not included in the scope of this document.

[![CAMS Cover Photo](static/CAMS.png)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/army-armee/migration/assets/army_internet/docs/en/national/2021-01-canadian-army-modernization-en.pdf)

[The Canadian Army Modernization Strategy (CAMS)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/army-armee/migration/assets/army_internet/docs/en/national/2021-01-canadian-army-modernization-en.pdf)

The purpose of The Canadian Army Modernization Strategy is to ensure the Army is positioned to address the numerous challenges in our turbulent security environment. It builds on the strategic guidance provided in Advancing with Purpose: The Army Strategy 3rd Edition, placing a pronounced emphasis on the multi-horizon modernization effort that we must undertake.
Moreover, it is fully nested under our Defence policy, Strong, Secure, Engaged (SSE). Fundamentally, this strategy serves as a critical statement of philosophy and principle, serving to achieve alignment across all elements of the Canadian Army by defining a common vision and end-state, and in doing so, it better enables the Canadian Army to fulfill its role as a central component of our joint force. Concurrently, it will help achieve similar alignment with our allies.

[![CAF AI Strategy Cover Photo](/static/DND_CAF%20AI%20Strategy.png)](https://collaboration-admdia.forces.mil.ca/sites/DIA/Pol/AI%20Strategy/AI%20Strategy%20Sections/AI%20Strategy%20Consultation%20Spring%202022/AI%20Strategy%20Review%20Draft%2020220408.pdf#search=AI%20Strategy)

The AI Strategy provides a vision and direction for the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and automated decision systems in the Defence Team. The operational capabilities and requirements of DND/CAF are at the heart of this approach, guiding the prioritization and need for this Strategy. As Canada’s allies and adversaries mature their approaches to this emerging technology, we must ensure that we balance innovation, security, and ethics to support the responsible and effective adoption of this technology where it can deliver the greatest advantage. The Strategy can also be read by partners in the Government of Canada, academia and industry, and partners and allies.

The purpose of this Data Strategy Implementation Plan (DSIP) is to build upon the previously published DND/CAF Data Strategy by transforming its activities and initiatives into a series of priority action items for ADM(DIA) and DND/CAF. These items will establish a path towards becoming a data-driven organization, which will result in fulfilling the DND/CAF data vision:
“Data are leveraged in all aspects of Defence programs, enhancing our Defence capabilities and decision-making, and providing an information advantage during military operations.”
It will also help DND/CAF fulfill three key data objectives:

* Providing operational advantage to DND/CAF in the battle space;
* Improving the management of the business of Defence; and
* Supporting DND/CAF senior leader decision making.

## Body of Knowledge(s)

[![DAMA-DMBOK Cover Photo](/static/DMBOK.png)](https://collaboration-admdia.forces.mil.ca/sites/DIA/Trg/Refs1/DAMA-DMBOK.pdf)

[DAMA'S Data Management Body of Knowledge: DAMA-DMBOK](https://collaboration-admdia.forces.mil.ca/sites/DIA/Trg/Refs1/DAMA-DMBOK.pdf)

Data Governance has become a standard structure in many organizations. New technologies have enabled the collection and use of 'Big Data' (semi structured and unstructured data in a wide range of formats), and the importance of data ethics has grown along with our ability to explore and exploit the vast amount of data and information produced as part of our daily lives. The BMBOK will serve data management professionals across the globe as a valuable resource and guide. Nevertheless, the DAMA international also recognize it is only a starting point. Real advancement will come as we apply and learn from these ideas. DAMA exists to enable members to learn continuously, by sharing ideas, trends, problems, and solutions.
