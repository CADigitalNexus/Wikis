## Guidance

Here are a good portion of the docs we need to mention.  We also want a graphic/visual representation of how they relate to one another (what is subordinate to what, and who is responsible for it).  Each one should have an image of the document, short description, link to the original (highlighting any CA specific or pertinent details to pay attention to)

## Doctrines

[Close Engagement](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/dnd-mdn/army/lineofsight/files/articlefiles/en/Close_Engagement.pdf)

Land Power in an Age of Uncertainty is the capstone future land operating concept designed to guide the development of Canadian land forces for the next 10 to 15 years. It has been written to nest within Canada’s defence policy and the CAF’s joint concepts, while providing the necessary underlying philosophy for organizing, equipping, training, and employing Canadian land forces within an integrated CAF joint force. It replaces the 2007 publication Land Operations 2021, Adaptive Dispersed Operations: The Force Employment Concept for Canada’s Army of Tomorrow, which was designed to serve “not as the end but rather the starting point for further debate, design, and development of the Army of Tomorrow."
