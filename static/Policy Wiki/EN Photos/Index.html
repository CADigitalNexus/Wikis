                <p class="missionstatement">Strong, Secure, Engaged offers clear direction on Canadian Defence priorities over a 20-year horizon. It increases the size of the Canadian Armed Forces, affirms Canada’s unwavering commitment to its long-standing alliances and partnerships, and provides vital new investments to ensure our women and men in uniform have the modern tools they need to succeed in – and return home safely from – operations. This policy transforms how we care for Canada’s military members and their families, from the time of recruitment to retirement and beyond. We believe this is critical to Canada’s security.</p>
   
                Canada's Defence Policy intends to deliver the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Well-supported, Diverse, Resilient People and Families</li>
                    <li>Defence Funding and Capability Investment</li>
                    <li>Strong at home, Secure in North America, Engaged in the world</li>
                    <li>A New Approach to Defence: Anticipate. Adapt. Act.</li>
