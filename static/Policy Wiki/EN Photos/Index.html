        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Strong, Secure, Engaged offers clear direction on Canadian Defence priorities over a 20-year horizon. It increases the size of the Canadian Armed Forces, affirms Canada’s unwavering commitment to its long-standing alliances and partnerships, and provides vital new investments to ensure our women and men in uniform have the modern tools they need to succeed in – and return home safely from – operations. This policy transforms how we care for Canada’s military members and their families, from the time of recruitment to retirement and beyond. We believe this is critical to Canada’s security. 

        This policy covers the following: 
        
        - Well-Supported, Diverse, Resilient People and Families 
        
        - Defence Funding and Capability Investment 
        
        - Strong at home, Secure in North America, Engaged in the world 
        
        - A New Approach to Defence: Anticipate. Adapt. Act. </p>
