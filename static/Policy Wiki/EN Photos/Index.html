        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Strong, Secure, Engaged offers clear direction on Canadian Defence priorities over a 20-year horizon. It increases the size of the Canadian Armed Forces, affirms Canada’s unwavering commitment to its long-standing alliances and partnerships, and provides vital new investments to ensure our women and men in uniform have the modern tools they need to succeed in – and return home safely from – operations. This policy transforms how we care for Canada’s military members and their families, from the time of recruitment to retirement and beyond. We believe this is critical to Canada’s security. 

    <p>Canada's Defence Policy covers the following: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Well-Supported, Diverse, Resilient People and Families </li>
        <li>Defence Funding and Capability Investment </li>
        <li>Strong at home, Secure in North America, Engaged in the world </li>
        <li>A New Approach to Defence: Anticipate. Adapt. Act.</li>
    </ul>
         </p>
