                <p class="policy>Canada's Defence Policy: Strong, Secure, Engaged (SSE)</p><p class="Mission Statement">Strong, Secure, Engaged offers clear direction on Canadian Defence priorities over a 20-year horizon. It increases the size of the Canadian Armed Forces, affirms Canada’s unwavering commitment to its long-standing alliances and partnerships, and provides vital new investments to ensure our women and men in uniform have the modern tools they need to succeed in – and return home safely from – operations. This policy transforms how we care for Canada’s military members and their families, from the time of recruitment to retirement and beyond. We believe this is critical to Canada’s security.</p>
